# "Weather Dashboard" 
  Created By: "Brad Webster" 
  ## Description:
  "After discovering the wide world of APIs, I was motivated to create my very first full stack application."
  "I built this Weather website to get hands on experience from sending and receiving real world data into a custom, purpose built application."
  "This website has the functionality of solving a real world problem we face almost everyday: \\\"What's the weather tomorrow?\\\""
  "By using openweather.org's API, I was able to learn how to fetch real world data, search it, deconstruct it, and repurpose it in the most user friendly way possible."
