Hello, my name is Brad Webster and I am student software developer
Welcome to a video walkthrough of my Readme Generator 
which is a Coding Project  made in part of the edX coding bootcamp 

So, I created this README Gen to save many coders, like myself,
time and energy from typing the same readme template over and over
(for reference) README is a text file  that Each computer program comes with- 
which is a standardized document that contains all the instructions and technical details of the program
Now , you can type this out from a blank page. But to save time, I created this program that will generate a Completed README, start to finish , with all the bells and whistles.

Today I will be walking through how to install, use, and operate this program

open IDE of your choice, see that this program isnt in there
step 1) navigate to github repo - clone
	add folder to workspace - notice generatedContent folder
step 2) npm install
3) node index
4) answer questions - bear with me these are long
