# "README Generator" 
  Created By: "Brad Webster" <br/>Student Software Developer - University of Richmond
  ## Description:
  After becoming frustrated by creating the same README files over and over for different projects, I became motivated to try and find another way. I built this generator to save time and headaches. Since README files generally have the same structure and questions answered, I figured it would be helpful to create a generator that saves time and energy for anyone with coding projects. I learned mostly about node.js and packages, specifically npm and inquirer. I found it to be a very helpful tool.
